## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
 
 I started by studying the desktop and mobile layouts with the different states. Then I created my css variables with the fonts and colours.
 After that I typed all the html and content and started to work on the style. I started with the main container and then created a notification-container. I didn't face any difficulties, the layout was pretty simple and straightforward.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

I want to keep practice integration of layout for different screen size and work with media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Doc media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - Usefull to remind myself of how it works
- [Shadow examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) -Helpful to quickly get a shadow example
